An embedding is a low-dimensional space that captures the relationship of vectors from a higher dimensional space. To better understand this concept, let's take a closer look at user embeddings. \n","\n","Imagine that we want to represent our users according to their preference for two genres of movies - action and romance movies. Let the first dimension be how much the user likes action movies, and the second dimension be how much the user likes romance movies.\n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/XENzqXq.png)\n","\n","Now, assume that Bob is our first user. Bob likes action movies but isn't a fan of romance movies. To represent Bob as a two dimensional vector, we place him in the graph according to his preference.\n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/rSStTCj.png)\n","\n","Our next user is Joe. Joe is a huge fan of both action and romance movies. We represent Joe using a two dimensional vector just like Bob.\n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/gmmkrEU.png)\n","\n","This two dimensional space is known as an embedding. Essentially, the embedding reduces our users such that they can be represented in a meaningful manner in a lower dimensional space. In this embedding, users with similar movie preferences are placed near to each other, and vice versa. \n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/9s9Z7JT.png)\n","\n","Of course, we are not restricted to using just 2 dimensions to represent our users. We can use an arbitrary number of dimensions to represent our users. A larger number of dimensions would allow us to capture the traits of each user more accurately, at the cost of model complexity. In our code, we'll use 8 dimensions (which we will see later).\n","\n","### Learned Embeddings\n","\n","Similarly, we will use a separate item embedding layer to represent the traits of the items (i.e. movies) in a lower dimensional space. \n","\n","You might be wondering, how can we learn the weights of the embedding layer, such that it provides an accurate representation of users and items? In our previous example, we used Bob and Joe's preference for action and romance movies to manually create our embedding. Is there a way to learn such preferences automatically? \n","\n","The answer is **Collaborative Filtering** - by using the ratings dataset, we can identify similar users and movies, creating user and item embeddings learned from existing ratings.\n","\n","### Model Architecture\n","\n","Now that we have a better understanding of embeddings, we are ready to define the model architecture. As you'll see, the user and item embeddings are key to the model.\n","\n","<!-- ![NCF](https://i.imgur.com/EZh1HHf.png)\n"," -->\n"," \n","Let's walk through the model architecture using the following training sample:\n","\n","| userId | movieID | interacted |\n","|-|-|-|\n","| 3 | 1 | 1 |\n","\n"," \n","![](https://i.imgur.com/cNWbIce.png)\n","\n","\n","The inputs to the model are the one-hot encoded user and item vector for `userId = 3` and `movieId = 1`. Because this is a positive sample (movie actually rated by the user), the true label (`interacted`) is 1.\n","\n","The user input vector and item input vector are fed to the user embedding and item embedding respectively, which results in a smaller, denser user and item vectors. \n","\n","The embedded user and item vectors are concatenated before passing through a series of fully connected layers, which maps the concatenated embeddings into a prediction vector as output. Finally, we apply a `Sigmoid` function to obtain the most probable class. In the example above, the most probable class is 1 (positive class), since 0.8 > 0.2.\n","\n","\n","Now, we use PyTorch to define this NCF model!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.153980Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.153532Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.172921Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.171734Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.153908Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class NCF(pl.LightningModule):\n","    \"\"\" Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)\n","    \n","        Args:\n","            num_users (int): Number of unique users\n","            num_items (int): Number of unique items\n","            ratings (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe containing the movie ratings for training\n","            all_movieIds (list): List containing all movieIds (train + test)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    \n","    def __init__(self, num_users, num_items, ratings, all_movieIds):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.user_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=num_users, embedding_dim=8)\n","        self.item_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=num_items, embedding_dim=8)\n","        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features=16, out_features=64)\n","        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(in_features=64, out_features=32)\n","        self.output = nn.Linear(in_features=32, out_features=1)\n","        self.ratings = ratings\n","        self.all_movieIds = all_movieIds\n","        \n","    def forward(self, user_input, item_input):\n","        \n","        # Pass through embedding layers\n","        user_embedded = self.user_embedding(user_input)\n","        item_embedded = self.item_embedding(item_input)\n","\n","        # Concat the two embedding layers\n","        vector = torch.cat([user_embedded, item_embedded], dim=-1)\n","\n","        # Pass through dense layer\n","        vector = nn.ReLU()(self.fc1(vector))\n","        vector = nn.ReLU()(self.fc2(vector))\n","\n","        # Output layer\n","        pred = nn.Sigmoid()(self.output(vector))\n","\n","        return pred\n","    \n","    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n","        user_input, item_input, labels = batch\n","        predicted_labels = self(user_input, item_input)\n","        loss = nn.BCELoss()(predicted_labels, labels.view(-1, 1).float())\n","        return loss\n","\n","    def configure_optimizers(self):\n","        return torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters())\n","\n","    def train_dataloader(self):\n","        return DataLoader(MovieLensTrainDataset(self.ratings, self.all_movieIds),\n","                          batch_size=512, num_workers=4)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We instantiate the NCF model using the class that we have defined above."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.175363Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.174841Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.306576Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.305447Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-01T12:22:53.175318Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["num_users = ratings['userId'].max()+1\n","num_items = ratings['movieId'].max()+1\n","\n","all_movieIds = ratings['movieId'].unique()\n","\n","model = NCF(num_users, num_items, train_ratings, all_movieIds)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-01T12:29:32.020613Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-01T12:29:32.020153Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=5,  reload_dataloaders_every_epoch=True,\n","                     progress_bar_refresh_rate=50, logger=False, checkpoint_callback=False)\n","\n","trainer.fit(model)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Evaluating our Recommender System\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Hit Ratio @ 10 \n","\n","Now, let's evaluate our model using the described protocol."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# User-item pairs for testing\n","test_user_item_set = set(zip(test_ratings['userId'], test_ratings['movieId']))\n","\n","# Dict of all items that are interacted with by each user\n","user_interacted_items = ratings.groupby('userId')['movieId'].apply(list).to_dict()\n","\n","hits = []\n","for (u,i) in tqdm(test_user_item_set):\n","    interacted_items = user_interacted_items[u]\n","    not_interacted_items = set(all_movieIds) -
